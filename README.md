# Getting_and_Cleaning_Data_Course_Project

 For creating one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The code works step by step, and at the end you come to the tidy_dataset, which i posted.
I have already used commentarys inside the code. So you can see for every step what IÂ´ve did.

You need to have packages plyr/dplyr and this dataset https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
